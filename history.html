    <h2>COMPANY PROFILE</h2>
    <p>Ghana Airways was founded on 4 July 1958 by the government of Ghana with start up capital of 3,000,000; 
the government holding a 60 percent stake, with BOAC holding the remainder.

When the company was founded, a seven-year agreement between the airline and BOAC was signed, which saw BOAC  
personnel being seconded to Accra, and Ghanaian personnel being trained in order for them to take over management 
and operation of the airline.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Prior to the foundation of the company, BOAC and West African Airways Corporation were responsible for international 
services from Ghana, operating pool services from West Africa to London. For their initial operations, Ghana Airways joined
 the pool services, when BOAC began operating the Accra-London route on 16 July 1958 with a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, with 
the aircraft being operated with the Ghanaian flag and in a livery minimally adapted from that of the UK carrier.

The airline's relationship with West African Airways ceased on 30 September, and on 1 October they began operating the 
domestic and regional flights formerly offered by WAAC
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
    The airline's first aircraft, and hence the first aircraft to be registered in Ghana since the nation became independent, was a 
de Havilland Heron delivered on 30 December.[3][5] At the end of the airline's first year of operation they had made a net 
profit of US$28,000
